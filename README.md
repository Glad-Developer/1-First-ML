├── templates/             # HTML templates for the Flask application
│   ├── index.html         # Home page
│   └── prediction.html    # Prediction page
├── venv/                  # Virtual environment files
├── app.py                 # Main Flask application file
├── README.md              # This file
├── requirements.txt       # Project dependencies
└── setup.py               # Script for building and distributing the project
```

## Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone <your-repository-url>
    cd mlproject
    ```

2.  **Create and activate a virtual environment (recommended):**
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    # On Windows
    venv\Scripts\activate
    # On macOS/Linux
    source venv/bin/activate
    ```

3.  **Install dependencies:**
    The `setup.py` file handles the installation of dependencies listed in `requirements.txt`.
    ```bash
    pip install -e .
    ```
    Alternatively, you can install directly from `requirements.txt`:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Usage

1.  **Run the Flask application:**
    ```bash
    python app.py
    ```

2.  **Open your web browser and navigate to:**
    `http://0.0.0.0:5000/` or `http://127.0.0.1:5000/`

3.  Use the web interface to input data and get predictions. The prediction page is usually at `/prediction`.
